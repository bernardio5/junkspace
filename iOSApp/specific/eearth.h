/* The eearth is a bunch of known shit.  I need a way of going from a lat, lon, time,  view direction, to a place in the galaxy  the origin is the center of the earth.  the direction of the vernal equinox is +z the earth's axis defines Y; +Y is north, the earth orbits -.  x is z cross y   the last vernal equinox was march 20 at 23:21;  the sun was over lon 2.971423 E this is no job for a dislexic fella.   At the vernal equinox, at lat/lon 0/2.97E,  at sea level, looking north! you should have  position = 0, 0, radius of earth view direction 0, 1, 0 view up 0, 0, 1 -- the direction of the VE. */#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>#import "mVec3.h"#import "mx4.h"@interface eearth : NSObject {    double lat, lon;     double dayOfYear, daysSinceVE, yearFract;    double inclination, heading;    int clockCounter;         // given allllll that other shit, here's you    mVec3 p, u, d;         // given that you're there, some directions for sanity-checking    mVec3 dueNorth, dueEast;         // hey! and here's the sun.
