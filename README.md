This repo contains two programs, the Junkspace iOS app, and a MacOS app. 

The iOS app is an "augmented reality" app, causing the phone screen to act as a lens, through which objects in orbit may be observed. 

The MacOS app was used with a projector of known location and orientation; it would show orbiting objects as they passed through the resulting view cone. 

Both apps show orbiting objects as pieces of electronic waste. The objects shown are all space debris: dead satellites, debris from explosions, discarded rocket stages, and the like. 

The object locations are knowable because US NORAD maintains a database of "TLE"'s: records that describe an orbiting objects and their paths around the Earth. JunkSpace uses these TLEs to correctly represent the positions of the objects.

The TLE's in this repo are several years old, you should update them if accuracy is important to you. There are few other celetial-positioning constants in the source that should be updated annually. 

Junkspace was shown in the ISEA 2012 exhibition, and a screengrab from it was used as the exibition catalog's cover. It has since been shown in other venues.
